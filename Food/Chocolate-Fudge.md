### Ingredients for No-Bake Chocolate Fudge

Here’s a basic list of ingredients you’ll need for making chocolate fudge:

- **40 pieces** of chocolate biscuit of your choice
- **2 tbsp** of honey
- **1/2 cup** of evaporated milk (adjust as needed for dough consistency)
- **100g dark or milk chocolate**
- **1 tablespoon** butter

- Optional: Dry fruits, chocochips, or sprinkles for garnish

### Steps to Make Chocolate Fudge

1. **Grind the biscuits**: Crush the biscuits & transfer them into a grinding jar to make a fine powder.
   
2. **Prepare the Dough**: In a bowl, combine the biscuit powder with honey. Gradually add milk to form a soft dough.

3. **Prepare the log**: Shape the dough into a log (as you would for making a roll) and flatten it into a rectangle.

4. **Refrigerate the fudge**: Wrap the log in silver foil and refrigerate or freeze it for about 1 hour, allowing it to firm up for easy cutting.

5. **Prepare the melted chocolate**: Melt the chocolate with butter in a microwave for 1 minute or use a double boiler method until smooth.

7. **Cut & Serve**: Once the dough is set, cut it into pieces, dip the above portion in the melted chocolate & garnish it with some dry fruits or your favourite toppings like chocochips or sprinklers. And enjoy!!

##### *Note: If you’re using cream biscuits, you can remove the cream from the biscuits before grinding them. Instead of using melted chocolate for garnish, mix the biscuit cream with a few teaspoons of milk until it has a smooth texture. Use this as a topping for a lighter, creamy finish.*

*Enjoy your homemade chocolate fudge!*

### Tips for Perfect Fudge

1. **Use High-Quality Chocolate**: The quality of your chocolate directly affects the taste of your fudge. Use good-quality cocoa powder or chocolate chips for the best flavor.
  
2. **Don’t Overcook**: Fudge can go from creamy to hard very quickly if overcooked. Keep a close eye on the temperature and test for the soft-ball stage as explained above.

3. **Mix Ins for Variety**: Chocolate fudge can be a base for various flavors and textures. Consider mixing in crushed cookies, peanut butter, marshmallows, or dried fruit for fun variations.

4. **Storage**: Store your fudge in an airtight container at room temperature or in the fridge for up to two weeks. You can also freeze it for longer storage.
